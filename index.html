        <h4> Project: Photo Gallery on Appengine (java) </h4>
	<p> A customer who wanted to have a photo album website that is
	easy to update. We decided to use G+ to upload and organize the photos. Once the
	photos are on G+ the website owner can login to an admin console and choose which
	albums are used on the site. The website uses these choices to create the site
	navigation.

        <h4>Project: Pydoit a task tracking application (python/gtk) </h4>
        <p >Pydoit will provide you with reminders of the tasks or steps that you need to complete. You can mark them as completed for each day and review what days those tasks
have been done. Each task is represented by a large button with a photo on it and optionally 
a sound. This application is intended to keep children on task but there is no reason adults 
could not use this system.

        <h4>Hobby: Digital Painting </h4>
        <p > Hahaha - I'm an artist! Just kidding. People have liked my paintings, true, but they are just for fun. I am on my third low end tablet at the moment. Its a Wacom Intuos cth-480. I mostly use MyPaint, but have been known to use many other applications too. It is a great way to relax and provides a guy with a chance to forget about all that other stuff (you know, that stuff you can not stop thinking about)
